<!-- Replit has been a bit of a disappointment.  Given the unreliability of the team projects (e.g., some of you, when forking the project repl, would not also be able to fork the `instructions.md` file), I am considering whether to post homework, exercises, etc. in a Github repository.

Thus, homework, exercises, etc., will be placed here: [Python Projects](https://github.com/multum-non-multa/python-projects)

Instructions as to how to find and download will be in the `README.md` file, visible below the file listing.

![readme](readme.jpg)

In general, you'll go to the folder marked `home-work-exercises-projects`.  Within that folder you'll find modules.

But all this is tentative right now. -->
