## Python

#### [Python's official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

Any time you are into documentation, it can be rather overwhelming.  Documentation is meant to be comprehensive and, thus, when you are early in the learning curve, much of what you see is without context and difficult to understand.  Don't worry about that.  As you continue to learn, more and more will make sense.  It is simply part of the learning process.

A few things to note:

- You want to be looking at version 3 of Python.  For many years the 2nd version was in wide use, even after 3 was introduced.  So you'll often see example code in the prior version.  The problem:  when Python implemented 3, it broke _backward compatibility_ and so sometimes old code will not work with a version 3 interpreter.

- When looking through in general, perhaps you want to start with the [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)

Just look around.  You'll see a lot of the basic stuff covered.
